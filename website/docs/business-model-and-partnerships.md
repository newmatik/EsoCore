## Proprietary Customization Model

### Market-Specific Intelligence

While the core platform remains open source, partners retain full ownership of their market-specific implementations:

- **Custom ML Models**: Partners can develop proprietary machine learning algorithms optimized for their specific equipment types and failure modes.
- **Industry-Specific Algorithms**: Specialized processing algorithms for unique sensor configurations or industry requirements remain proprietary to each partner.
 - **Custom Sensor Modules**: Partners can introduce exclusive or proprietary sensors as RS‑485 modules that integrate seamlessly with the platform without modifying the Core or architecture.
- **Configuration Management**: Custom device configurations, thresholds, and operational parameters specific to partner applications.
- **Data Analytics**: Proprietary analytics and reporting capabilities tailored to specific industry needs and customer requirements.

### Development Options

- **Partnership with Newmatik**: Partners can collaborate with Newmatik for custom development, leveraging our expertise while maintaining ownership of proprietary components.
- **Independent Development**: Partners have complete freedom to develop custom features in-house using the open-source platform as a foundation.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of Newmatik collaboration for core features and independent development for highly specialized requirements.
