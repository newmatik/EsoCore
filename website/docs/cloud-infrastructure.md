# Cloud Infrastructure

EsoCore provides a comprehensive cloud infrastructure solution consisting of two main components: a scalable Django REST API backend and a modern Nuxt.js frontend portal. This infrastructure is designed to be flexible, allowing deployment as a managed SaaS service by Newmatik or self-hosted by partners.

## Architecture Overview

The EsoCore cloud infrastructure follows a microservices-like architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Backend API (Django)**: Handles all IoT device communication, data processing, and business logic
- **Frontend Portal (Nuxt.js)**: Provides the user interface for monitoring and management
- **Database**: Stores device data, telemetry, user information, and system configuration
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket support for live updates and alerts

## Backend: Django REST API Server

### Backend Core Features

The Django server serves as the central nervous system for the entire IoT ecosystem, providing:

- **Device Management**: Complete lifecycle management of IoT devices with secure API key authentication
- **Telemetry Ingestion**: High-performance time-series data collection from sensors and devices
- **Asset Monitoring**: Equipment tracking, maintenance scheduling, and lifecycle management
- **Event Processing**: Real-time system events, alerts, and automated responses
- **User Management**: Role-based access control with customizable permissions
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Backend Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Django 5.2 with Django REST Framework 3.16
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Authentication**: Dual-mode authentication supporting both API keys (devices) and session-based (users)
- **API Documentation**: DRF Spectacular with interactive Swagger UI
- **Deployment Ready**: Docker containerization with production-optimized settings

### Backend Scalability Features

The Django backend is designed for horizontal and vertical scaling:

- **Database Optimization**: Efficient query patterns and indexing for high-throughput telemetry data
- **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for session management and frequently accessed data
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background task processing for heavy computations
- **Load Balancing Ready**: Stateless design supporting multiple server instances
- **API Rate Limiting**: Built-in throttling to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage

### Key API Endpoints

**Device-Facing Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/iot/v1/auth/handshake` - Device authentication
- `POST /api/iot/v1/telemetry/batch` - Bulk telemetry data ingestion
- `GET /api/iot/v1/config` - Device configuration retrieval
- `GET /api/iot/v1/ota/check` - Over-the-air update availability
- `POST /api/iot/v1/ota/report` - Update status reporting

**Management Endpoints:**

- `/api/devices/` - Device CRUD operations
- `/api/sites/` - Site management
- `/api/assets/` - Asset monitoring
- `/api/events/` - Event and alert management
- `/api/telemetry/` - Historical data access

## Frontend: Nuxt.js Portal

### Frontend Core Features

The Nuxt.js portal provides a modern, responsive web interface for end-users:

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live device monitoring with interactive telemetry visualization
- **Device Management**: Complete device lifecycle management through web interface
- **Asset Tracking**: Equipment monitoring and predictive maintenance scheduling
- **Alert Management**: Real-time notifications and alert escalation
- **User Management**: Role-based access control and user profile management
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive interface optimized for all devices

### Frontend Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Nuxt.js 4.0 (Vue.js 3) with server-side rendering
- **UI Library**: Nuxt UI with Tailwind CSS and Headless UI components
- **Charts & Visualization**: Chart.js and ApexCharts for data visualization
- **State Management**: Pinia for centralized state management
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with automatic retry and error handling
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data streaming

### Frontend Scalability Features

The Nuxt.js portal is built for performance and scale:

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Improved SEO and initial page load performance
- **Static Site Generation**: Option for CDN deployment with pre-rendered pages
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based code splitting for optimal bundle sizes
- **Caching Strategies**: Intelligent caching for API responses and static assets
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline capabilities and native app-like experience

### Frontend Deployment Options

- Server-side rendering for dynamic content
- Easy integration with existing infrastructure
- Customizable branding and theming

## Integration and Communication

### API Communication

The portal communicates with the Django backend through a well-defined REST API:

```typescript
// Example API integration
const { data: devices } = await $api('/devices/')
const { data: telemetry } = await $api('/telemetry/', {
  params: { device_id, start_date, end_date }
})
```

### Real-time Updates

WebSocket connections enable real-time data streaming:

```typescript
// Real-time device status updates
const { connect, subscribe } = useWebSocket()
connect()
subscribe('devices', (data) => {
  // Update UI with live data
})
```

### Authentication Flow

- **Device Authentication**: API key-based with device-specific tokens
- **User Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh capability
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based sessions for web interface

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- API key rotation and secure storage
- Database encryption at rest
- Secure communication protocols (HTTPS/WSS)

### Access Control
