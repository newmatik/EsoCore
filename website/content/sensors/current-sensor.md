## Overview
Isolated Hall‑effect current sensing with motor load analysis, harmonic content monitoring, and power quality metrics.

## Features
- ±30 A range (others optional)
- RMS current, THD, harmonics
- Load factor and torque estimation

## Applications
- Motor load and efficiency
- Pump/fan performance
- Electrical fault diagnostics

## Edge Integration
Streams RMS and power metrics over RS‑485; thresholds and alarms configurable in the Edge UI.
