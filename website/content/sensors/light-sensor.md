# Light Sensor Module

## Overview
The Light Sensor Module provides multi‑spectrum light analysis for industrial safety and process control, combining visible light, UV, IR, color and spectral sensing.

## Features
- Visible light (lux, wide dynamic range)
- UV‑A/UV‑B monitoring
- IR temperature via non‑contact sensor (optional)
- RGB color with IR blocking filter
- 10‑channel spectral sensing (violet → NIR)

## Applications
- Workplace lighting compliance and emergency lighting validation
- UV exposure safety monitoring
- Process control for light‑sensitive manufacturing
- Color quality and batch uniformity checks
- Spectral analysis for material characterization

## Edge Integration
Connects to the Edge via RS‑485. Auto‑discovery registers capabilities; thresholds and sampling are configurable in the web UI.
