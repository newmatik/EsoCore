# Vibration Sensor Module

## Overview
Provides 3‑axis vibration analysis with FFT processing and RMS metrics for rotating equipment health monitoring and predictive maintenance.

## Features
- High‑precision 3‑axis accelerometer
- FFT spectra, RMS, crest factor, kurtosis
- 1–3 kHz ODR windows for diagnostics
- On‑device DSP to reduce bandwidth

## Applications
- Motor bearing monitoring
- Gear mesh and imbalance detection
- Pump cavitation and structural resonance

## Edge Integration
Streams processed metrics and spectra to the Edge over RS‑485; configurable sampling and alarms via the web UI.
