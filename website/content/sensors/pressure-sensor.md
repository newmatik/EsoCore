Multi‑range pressure sensing for hydraulic and pneumatic systems with diagnostics for leak detection and process control.

## Features
- Ranges: 0–1, 0–10, 0–100 bar
- Differential/gauge/absolute options
- Fast response for transients

## Applications
- Leak rate and filter clogging
- Pump and valve performance
- Process pressure validation

## Edge Integration
Real‑time pressure data and alarms via RS‑485; sampling/filters configurable in the Edge UI.
