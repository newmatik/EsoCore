# Bill of Materials (Preliminary)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

This is an early, approximate BOM at 1k quantity based on requirements. Prices are indicative only and subject to change.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** These figures reflect material (BOM) cost only. Assembly costs are not included.

The EsoCore system consists of the **Edge** (installed in the control cabinet) and separate **Sensor Modules** (mounted directly on machinery). This modular approach allows optimal placement while keeping sensitive electronics protected.

**Industrial Connector Strategy**: All sensor modules use **4-pin screw terminal blocks** with PG9 cable glands for maximum field serviceability and cost effectiveness. Standard 4-conductor shielded cable can be cut to length and terminated in the field. The Edge features dedicated **terminal block arrays** for different I/O types, enabling clean professional installation with clear functional separation.
