# CRITICAL: GitHub Pages redirect rules for EsoCore documentation
# 
# IMPORTANT: These rules handle trailing slash normalization for static hosting.
# They work by redirecting URLs with trailing slashes to clean URLs without
# trailing slashes, ensuring consistent canonical URLs.
#
# The static site generation creates both variants of files, but these rules
# ensure users always see the clean URL format.
#
# DO NOT MODIFY without understanding the complete routing system.

# Redirect trailing slashes to clean URLs (force parameter ensures override)
