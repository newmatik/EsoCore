# EsoCore Hardware

## General Layout Requirements

- Prefer SMD components; avoid THT where feasible
- Provide Tag-Connect pads for MCU programming
- Include three fiducials on each SMD-assembled side
- Avoid single-sourcing; specify at least two MPNs where practical (exceptions: MCU or unique sensors)
- Evaluate cost-effective alternatives on LCSC, including reputable Chinese brands, not only established manufacturers
